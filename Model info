About the data

You are asked to make predictions for each unique id in the test dataset about the likelihood of the person having a bank account. You will train your model on 70% of the data and test your model on the final 30% of the data.

X_train is 70% of the data, across the four East African countries (i.e. Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda)

X_test is 30% of the complete dataset across the East African countries.
